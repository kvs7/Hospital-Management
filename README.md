## How to Run

### Using nodemon (Development):

[nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) is a tool that helps in developing Node.js-based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

1. Install nodemon globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g nodemon
   ```
2. Run the application using nodemon:

   ```bash
   nodemon your-app.js
   ```
This approach is recommended during the development phase as it automatically restarts the server on code changes.

### Using node (Production):

For production, it's common to use node directly. You need to manually restart the server when changes are made to the code.

1. Run the application using node:

   ```bash
   node your-app.js
   ```
